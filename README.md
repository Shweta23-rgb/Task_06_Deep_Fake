# Task_06_Deep_Fake

📌 Overview

This project is part of my research assignment on AI-generated “deep fake” interviews. The goal was to transform a dataset narrative into an interview-style format using AI tools. I used the 2021 Women’s Happiness dataset (combined with the World Happiness Report) to script a short 1-minute conversation between two speakers: Jessica (host) and Liam (researcher/expert).

The final output is an AI-generated audio interview that demonstrates how free text-to-speech tools can simulate a dialogue.

Process

Script Creation

Drafted a natural-sounding conversation between Jessica (host) and Liam (expert).

Focused on highlighting insights from the dataset: top countries, role of equality, GDP vs happiness, and key takeaways.

Tool Exploration

Tried HeyGen, Synthesia, Elai.io for video generation.

Discovered that most video/avatar tools require payment for full features (avatars, lip sync, multiple speakers).

Audio Generation

Switched to TTS Maker (a free text-to-speech tool).

Generated Jessica’s and Liam’s lines separately using different voices.

Combined them into a single 1-minute audio interview.

Output

Final result is an audio file simulating an interview.

While it is not perfect, it demonstrates the process of using AI tools for narrative transformation.

🚧 Challenges

Most Tools Were Paid

Free versions of HeyGen, Synthesia, and Elai.io were too limited for a proper two-person video interview.

Lip Syncing Issues

Even in trial versions, the avatar lip movements didn’t match speech naturally.

TTS Limitations

TTS Maker sometimes spelled out names (“J-E-S-S-I-C-A”) instead of speaking them.

Voices sounded somewhat robotic and less conversational.

Balancing Quality with Free Tools

Free solutions were enough to demonstrate the concept but lacked polish.

💡 Learnings

Process over product: The main value was experimenting with tools and documenting workflow, not producing a Hollywood-quality deep fake.

Free TTS tools can effectively create a conversation, but sound artificial at times.

Realistic deep fakes require advanced (often paid) platforms for natural voices, accurate lip sync, and smoother multi-speaker interaction.
